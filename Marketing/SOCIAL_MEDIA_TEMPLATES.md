### LinkedIn Success Story Post

üí° Customer Success: "Saved 14 hours on a deadline project"

Sarah, a project architect in Seattle, had 3 days to fix 200+ sheets with wrong title blocks before a permit submission.

Manual approach: 14+ hours
With ReviPrompt Lab: 23 minutes

Here's what happened:
1. Used Sheet Setup Master prompt
2. AI generated Dynamo script
3. Batch processed all sheets
4. Auto-aligned viewports
5. Generated updated sheet index

Result: Project submitted on time, weekend saved.

This is why I created ReviPrompt Lab - to give architects their time back for actual design work.

### Tips Thread
```
üßµ Thread: 5 Revit tasks you should NEVER do manually

1/6 Sheet renumbering

Stop manually changing numbers. Use AI to:
- Parse existing patterns
- Generate new sequences
- Handle discipline prefixes
- Update sheet index automatically

2/6 Title block swapping

Don't click each sheet. Batch process:
- Preserve all sheet data
- Handle different sizes
- Maintain viewport positions
- Generate change log

3/6 Annotation cleanup

Forget hunting missing tags. Automate:
- Find untagged elements
- Apply correct tag types
- Remove duplicates
- Align to avoid overlaps

4/6 Export management

Skip the export dialog 50 times. Script it:
- Multi-format simultaneous export
- Consistent naming rules
- Folder organization
- Quality validation

5/6 QA checks

Don't rely on memory. Systematize:
- Sheet name validation
- ADA compliance scanning
- Parameter completeness
- Cross-reference accuracy
