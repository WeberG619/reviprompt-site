# Address Still Showing - Cache Clearing Instructions

## The Issue
You've removed all physical addresses from the code, but they're still showing on the live website. This is a **caching problem**.

## Solutions (Try in this order):

### 1. Hard Refresh Your Browser
- **Chrome/Edge**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- **Firefox**: `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- **Safari**: `Cmd + Option + R`

### 2. Clear Browser Cache
- Open browser settings
- Find "Clear browsing data" or "Clear cache"
- Select "All time" and clear cache/cookies
- Restart browser

### 3. Try Incognito/Private Mode
- Open a new incognito/private window
- Visit your site - if the address is gone here, it's definitely a cache issue

### 4. If Using Squarespace (Your Live Site):

#### Option A: Force Squarespace Refresh
1. Login to Squarespace admin
2. Go to Settings → Advanced → Code Injection
3. Add this temporary code to the HEADER:
```html
<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate">
<meta http-equiv="Pragma" content="no-cache">
<meta http-equiv="Expires" content="0">
```
4. Save and wait 5-10 minutes
5. Remove the code after clearing

#### Option B: Re-upload Your Files
1. Since you're hosting on Squarespace, you may need to:
2. Re-upload your updated HTML/CSS files
3. Or republish/redeploy your site from the admin panel

### 5. Check Multiple Devices/Networks
- Try viewing the site from:
  - Your phone (different network)
  - A different computer
  - Ask someone else to check

### 6. Wait for CDN Cache Expiry
- If using a CDN (Content Delivery Network), changes can take 15-60 minutes to propagate globally
- Wait 1 hour and check again

## Verification Methods:

### Check if it's really gone:
1. View page source (`Ctrl + U`)
2. Search for "123 Innovation" or "Tech Hub"
3. If it's not in the source code, it's definitely a cache issue

### Test with cache-busting:
Add `?v=123` to your URL like: `revipromptlab.com/contact?v=123`

## Most Likely Solution:
Since we confirmed the code is clean, this is almost certainly a **browser cache issue**. The hard refresh (Solution #1) should fix it immediately.

## Contact Page Should Show:
- ✅ "Digital-First Support" section  
- ✅ Email: support@revipromptlab.com
- ✅ "Remote-first company" messaging
- ❌ NO physical addresses anywhere
