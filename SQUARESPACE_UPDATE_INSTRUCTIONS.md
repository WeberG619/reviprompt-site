# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Fix Contact Page Address on Squarespace

## The Problem
Your live website at revipromptlab.com still shows:
- **Address**: "123 Innovation Drive, Tech Hub, CA 94105"  
- **Office Hours**: Monday-Friday 9 AM - 6 PM PST
- **"Visit Our Office"** section

This needs to be removed BEFORE you start marketing!

## Why It's Still There
You're hosting on **Squarespace**, which means:
- The GitHub code we updated doesn't automatically sync to your live site
- Squarespace is serving cached/old content
- You need to manually update the contact page in Squarespace

## How to Fix It (Step by Step):

### **Option 1: Update in Squarespace Editor**
1. **Login to Squarespace**: Go to your Squarespace admin panel
2. **Edit Contact Page**: Find "Pages" â†’ "Contact" â†’ "Edit"
3. **Remove Address Section**: Delete the entire "Visit Our Office" block
4. **Remove Office Hours**: Delete business hours section
5. **Replace with**: 
   ```
   Digital-First Support
   
   Email is our preferred method for support
   support@revipromptlab.com
   
   We operate as a remote-first company to serve 
   customers globally with digital efficiency 
   and 24/7 documentation access.
   ```
6. **Save and Publish**: Click "Save" then "Publish Changes"

### **Option 2: Upload New HTML (If using custom code)**
1. **Export our clean files**: Use the updated contact page from GitHub
2. **Upload to Squarespace**: Replace the contact page HTML
3. **Test thoroughly**

### **Option 3: Quick Fix (Immediate)**
If you can't access the editor right now:
1. **Add a banner** at the top: "We operate digitally - contact via email only"
2. **Hide the address section** with CSS until you can properly remove it

## Verification Steps:
1. **Clear your browser cache**: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
2. **Check in incognito mode**: Open private/incognito window
3. **Test on mobile**: Verify it's fixed on mobile too
4. **Ask someone else to check**: Get a second pair of eyes

## What the Contact Page Should Show:
âœ… **Email Support**: support@revipromptlab.com  
âœ… **Digital-First messaging**  
âœ… **Remote operations explanation**  
âœ… **No physical address**  
âœ… **No office hours**  
âœ… **No "Visit Our Office" section**

## âš¡ This is CRITICAL before marketing launch!
Having a fake address while advertising will:
- Destroy credibility with potential customers
- Create legal/compliance issues
- Make you look unprofessional
- Waste your marketing efforts

**Fix this TODAY before posting any LinkedIn content!**
